## Background

This was the first project for the Founders and Coders pre-apprenticeship course. Further details on the requirements can be found at this [link](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-apprenticeship/markup/project/).  

## Details 

We decided to theme the agency on Formula One racing (a passion of [@alternadiva](https://github.com/alternadiva)). We not only staffed the company with eminent (primarily dead) drivers, but also used the theme to inform various aspects of the website design. The colours were based on the flags of Formula One, with the iconic chequered flag forming its keynote. In keeping with the project requirements, the website is designed to be functional on different devices, including screen-readers. 

## Technical Information

- The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://lascellesabercrombie.github.io/agency-website/)
- The website is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- We haven't used any external libraries
